        <p>
          <strong>TRIFLES</strong> is an innovative mobile application designed to revolutionize the way farmers access markets by directly connecting them with buyers. In the traditional system, farmers often rely on intermediaries who take a substantial portion of the profits, leaving the producers with minimal returns. TRIFLES seeks to eliminate these intermediaries, providing farmers with direct access to consumers, wholesalers, and retailers, thereby empowering them to earn more from their hard work.

          Through <strong>TRIFLES</strong>, farmers can list their produce, negotiate prices directly with buyers, and receive payments securely through the platform. The appâ€™s intuitive design ensures ease of use, making it accessible even to users with minimal technical expertise. Additionally, TRIFLES helps buyers discover fresh produce from local farmers, making it a win-win solution for everyone involved.
